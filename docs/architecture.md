# Architecture

Read before creating a crate, adding a dependency between crates, or touching the frame loop.

## Crate map (Cargo workspace)

| Crate | Owns | May depend on |
|---|---|---|
| `core` | Instance tree, arena, properties, events, services | nothing engine-internal |
| `render` | `wgpu` renderer | nothing engine-internal; takes a draw list |
| `physics` | `rapier3d` integration | `core` |
| `script` | Lua 5.4 (`mlua`), sandbox, scheduler, engine API | `core` |
| `blocks` | block-script model and translation to Lua | `core` (not `script`) |
| `ui` | game UI: CSS subset, `taffy` layout, UI draw data | `core` |
| `audio` | `kira` integration | `core` |
| `project` | project folder load and save, export packing | `core` |
| `player` | the runtime shipped with games (binary) | `core`, `render`, `physics`, `script`, `ui`, `audio`, `project` |
| `editor` | `egui` editor app (binary) | everything |

Rules:
- `player` must **never** depend on `editor`, `egui` or `blocks`. The editor runs the export pipeline: `blocks` translates block scripts to Lua, then `project` packs the result.
- `render` never sees Instances, scripts or the editor. Something outside it turns the world into a draw list (meshes, materials, transforms, lights, camera).
- Don't let crates depend on each other in a cycle. If two crates need each other, move the shared type into `core`.
- Pin dependency versions in the workspace's root `Cargo.toml` (`[workspace.dependencies]`).

## Data model

- One tree of **Instances**: class, `Name`, `Parent`, children, typed properties and events.
- Instances live in an **arena** and are referenced by **generational IDs** (index plus generation). Never use `Rc<RefCell<…>>` parent/child pointers.
- An ID can outlive its Instance. Every lookup returns an `Option` or `Result`; never assume the Instance still exists.

## Frame order (fixed, do not reorder casually)

1. Read input
2. Resume coroutines whose wait has expired, and fire queued events
3. Step physics at a fixed 60 Hz (accumulator; may run 0–N steps per frame)
4. Fire `Touched` and collision events
5. Update UI layout (`taffy`)
6. Build the draw list and render

## Play mode

Play runs in-process on a **deep copy** of the edit world, and Stop drops the copy. Before Play: autosave. During Play: the Lua watchdog is active, and Rust panics are caught at the Play boundary and reported to the Output panel.

## Portability

Target Windows, macOS and Linux. All runtime file access goes through the asset system, never direct `std::fs` calls in gameplay code, so web and mobile stay possible later.
